This is the README file for Data::Dumper, the Perl
data-structure printing/stringification module.

Perl Version 5.001 or later is required.

You may find this module useful if you:

   * are writing an application that must display perl data
     structures (Dumper is being used in a perl debugger)

   * want to store some data structures to disk, in either a
     compact or perl readable format (Dumper outputs pure perl,
     so you don't have to invent your own portable data format, or
     parse it;  simply read the data back in with perl and eval() it).

The 'eg' directory contains a trivial module I wrote to store
multidimensional structures in DBM files.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
