=head1 DESCRIPTION

The following functionality will be supported in the next few releases.

=over 4

=item $Data::Dumper::Useqq  I<or>  $I<OBJ>->Useqq(I<[NEWVAL]>)

When set, enables the use of double quotes for representing string values.
Whitespace other than space will be represented as C<[\n\t\r]>, "unsafe"
characters will be backslashed, and unprintable characters will be output as
quoted octal integers.  Since setting this variable imposes a performance
penalty, the default is 0.

=item $Data::Dumper::Freezer  I<or>  $I<OBJ>->Freezer(I<[NEWVAL]>)

Can be set to the method name that you want Dumper to call before attempting
to stringify an object.  This method can alter the contents of the object
(if, for instance, it contains data allocated from C), and even rebless it
in a different package.  The client is responsible for making sure the
specified method can be called via the object, and that the object ends up
containing only perl data types after the method has been called.

=item $Data::Dumper::Maxdepth I<or> $I<OBJ>->Maxdepth(I<NEWVAL>)

Depth beyond which we don't venture into a structure.  Has no effect when
C<Data::Dumper::Purity> is set.  (useful in debugger when we often don't
want to see more than enough).

=item  $Data::Dumper::Expdepth I<or> $I<OBJ>->Expdepth(I<NEWVAL>)

Dump contents explicitly up to a certain depth and then use names for
cross-referencing identical references.  (useful in debugger, in situations
where we don't care so much for cross-references).
